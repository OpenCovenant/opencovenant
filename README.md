## OpenCovenant - environment fostering the open-source vision

Welcome to the OpenCovenant community! We are pleased to be hosting the
[**penda**](https://github.com/OpenCovenant/ink) project. If you are new to GitHub, please check
the [Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) page. We want to draw attention to
the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) set up for OpenCovenant (BesÃ«lidhja e Hapur), as it outlines important aspects
of the interactions in this space.

### Incentives Aligned, Leadership and Development

Our incentives are aligned, if you choose adding to the pie instead of taking a bigger slice out of it. If you often
find yourself [rent-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking), then this environment is definitely not for
you.

The founder of a project is typically expected to serve as
the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life), or thereafter elaborate on their vision and pass
on the mantel. Other leadership forms of open-source projects are also welcomed. We encourage adopting standardized
tools, languages, frameworks. Of greater importance is for the development team to be on the same page, as certain
specifics can rarely be determined ahead of time.
